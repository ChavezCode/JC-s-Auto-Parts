    <p class="bg">JC's Auto is a family owned business located in the heart of the Willamette Valley. In 1989, JC started his
        first business, a mechanic shop that fixed vehicles around the local area. He soon realized that most of his customers
        vehicles were starting to pile up outside his shop while he waited for parts.

        <em>As time passes, more and more Americans rely on their vehicles to get from point A to point B.
            There are many places around the nation that don't have stores with parts available to them.
            Some people drive 10 minutes to the auto part store, others drive 2-4 hours.
            I wanted to create a site where people could buy things at an affordable price, that it successfully went through, and knowing that they could
            get it delivered in time. My goal has always been to help people. </em>
